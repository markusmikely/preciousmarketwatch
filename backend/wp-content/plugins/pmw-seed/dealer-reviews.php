    'JM Bullion' => [
        'review' => 'JM Bullion has carved out a strong reputation for competitive pricing and lean operations. Their low-premium business model appeals to cost-conscious investors. The site is straightforward and responsive, with real-time pricing that updates frequently. Shipping is fast and reliable. However, their selection is more limited than larger competitors, and their educational content is minimal. Customer service is competent but less proactive. Good for repeat investors who know what they want; less ideal for beginners seeking guidance.',

    'Blue Nile' => [
        'review' => 'Blue Nile revolutionized diamond retail with their transparent pricing model and 360° imaging technology. Their certification standards are rigorous, with all diamonds GIA-certified. Selection is massive—over 200,000 diamonds to choose from—and the comparison tools are excellent. Prices are competitive due to their direct-to-consumer model. However, they don\'t handle physical inspection well remotely, and their gemstone expertise is diamond-focused. Return policy is strong (30 days). Best for serious diamond buyers seeking transparency and choice.',

    'James Allen' => [
        'review' => 'James Allen is a close competitor to Blue Nile with slightly more advanced imaging technology and a younger, more dynamic brand. Their 3D zoom feature is technically superior. Selection is large and comparable to Blue Nile. Pricing is similarly transparent and competitive. Where James Allen differs is in customer experience—their interface feels more modern. However, they lack the educational depth of Blue Nile, and their return policy is slightly more restrictive. Good choice if you prefer their tech and interface over Blue Nile\'s educational approach.',

    ],
    'SD Bullion' => [
        'review' => 'SD Bullion has built a loyal following through aggressive pricing and no-nonsense operations. Their premiums are among the lowest in the industry, making them attractive to volume buyers and investors prioritizing cost. Shipping is fast and secure. However, their website feels dated, selection is smaller than larger competitors, and educational content is minimal. Customer service is adequate but not exceptional. Best for experienced investors who just want the lowest price on standard bullion products.',

    'Augusta Precious Metals' => [
        'review' => 'Augusta Precious Metals specializes in precious metals IRAs, targeting retirement investors. Their consultative approach and IRA expertise are notable strengths. They provide educational content specific to retirement planning with precious metals. However, their pricing for physical purchases is higher than spot dealers due to their advisory model. Service is more white-glove than transactional. Not ideal for spot market buyers, but excellent for IRA-focused investors seeking personalized guidance. High minimum purchase requirements reflect their institutional focus.',
